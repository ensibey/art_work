# Artwork Creation Code

This Python script takes image files from a user-specified file location and arranges these images in the shape of the user's choice (squares, circles, or triangles) to create an artwork. The user can choose the shape they want to use for the arrangement.

## Usage

1. Run the code and enter the path of the folder where the image files are located.

2. Select the shape (squares, circles, or triangles) in which you want to arrange the images.

3. The code will arrange the images based on the chosen shape and create an artwork.

4. Save the artwork as 'artwork.png' and view it.

## Requirements

- Python
- Pillow or PIL module

## Notes

- The code arranges the images in a random layout.
- You can modify the code to add more shape options.

This code can be a useful tool for users interested in creating artwork and editing images.
